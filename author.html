            Hi. I'm glad to see you here <br/>
            My name is Mateusz and I am a high school student from Poland
            <br/><br/>
            What more can I say? Since primary school I'm really into IT<br/>
            I started with coding simple C++ programs, then moved to web-dev
            Right now, except for this blog, I am learning cybersecurity and preparing myself for some exams
            <br/><br/>
            But I'm not only a IT guy - in meantime I enjoy reading some sci-fi or political fiction books<br/>
            Also spending time on watching series, films and especially cartoons is cool for me.
            As for more productive, non-IT hobbys I am learning to play the guitar and I'm really into history (that's pretty much why there is "offtop" category)
