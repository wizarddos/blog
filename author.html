            Hi. I'm glad to see you here. <br/>
            My name is Mateusz and I am a high school student from Poland.
            <br/><br/>
            What more can I say? Since primary school I have really been into IT<br/>
            I started with coding simple C++ programs, then moved to web-dev.
            Right now, apart from this blog, I am learning cybersecurity and preparing myself for some exams.
            <br/><br/>
            But I'm not only an IT guy - in the meantime I enjoy reading some sci-fi or political fiction books.<br/>
            I also spend time on watching series, films and sometimes cartoons.
            As for more productive, non-IT hobbies I am learning to play the guitar and I'm really into history (that's pretty much why there is "offtop" category)
