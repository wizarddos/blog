Welcome again - Let's begin our journey

What will we do today? Sorry, but not coding yet 

We'll be setting up our PHP development server. Then we'll test if it works

Sooo, there will be some code.
<!--more-->

To the point - what will we learn today?
1. Choosing code editor
2. Setting up environment - Windows 
3. Setting up environment - Debian-based Linuxes

Let's get started

### 1. Code editor

First thing we need is **code editor**

There've been countless discussions about it online - One google search gave me about 234,000,000 results, so I think this shows the scale pretty damm great

As many developers, as many opinions - every code tutorial might suggest you a diffretent one
So, which one to choose?

Personally, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Or **VSCode** in short).

But, that's not the only one. To name a few other
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - Also a solid choice. I love it's theme (called `monokai`)  and use it everywhere (in this blog as well)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - My first code editor. I have some sort of sentiment towards it, but it has pretty outdated UI
- [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) - Paid IDE for PHP. Most PHP devs love it, I never tried it to be fair.

If you coded before - you can use whatever suits you the most. 
There are much more important things than code editor

I'll use VSCode here and I suggest you to do it as well, especially if you've never wrote code in your life
It offers built-in tutorial on how to use it and supports most of the languages

Also, go to `Extensions` (Ctrl+Shift+X) and install these 2-
- [PHP Intelephense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client)
- [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense)


First one suggests you functions as you type, and second helps you with paths (especially relative ones, you will learn about them in this course too)

To install it, download official package from their website and 
- Follow it's instructions (on windows)
- Or install it with `dpkg` (in debian-based linux)


```bash
sudo dpkg -i [Path to .deb package]
```

When you really can't download it, there's always [web version](https://vscode.dev/) of it

![Visual studio Code in it's pure form](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s6w0jhdkzkkh8rwe2kw9.png)

Don't worry about code, you will learn it late

### 2. Environment - Windows 

Now we need to have a place running our codes - let's start with windows

We will use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) package

XAMPP stands for
X - Cross-platform
A - Apache (Server used to run PHP)
M - MariaDB (Our database, DBMS to be more specific)
P - PHP (Programming language we will learn)
P - Perl (Another programming language not mentioned in this course)

Choose version for windows. Then open downloaded `.exe` file and install it

Once installed go to `C:/xampp` (Or any other place where you have installed it). It should look like this


![XAMPP folder](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2qwvvw2t2mvy2xv2cxao.png)

XAMPP folder view

I have **file extensions** shown - you should as well.

In windows explorer, click on “View,” select “Show,” and choose the “File name extensions” option to show extensions

Coming back, we have 2 important places here

1. `htdocs` folder

![htdocs folder in explorer](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m3lsgh0fgh4lphqikynb.png)
That's where PHP code goes
Delete it's whole content - we won't need it

Instead, create a new folder called `server-test` and inside it file called `index.php`. 

Why is this file called `index.php` and not `first.php`? 

`index` is commonly agreed name of main page - it comes from old internet versions. `Index` file used to redirect us to other subpages

If we wanted to visit `https://example.com/`, but developer hadn't declared `index.php` - we would see every file and folder from website's directory (So called **directory listing**)

But `index.php` is not the only index file - for example Apache in XAMPP has pretty decent list of those
```conf
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.pl index.cgi index.asp index.shtml index.html index.htm \
                   default.php default.pl default.cgi default.asp default.shtml default.html default.htm \
                   home.php home.pl home.cgi home.asp home.shtml home.html home.htm
```

So, if you create a file with any of those names - Apache will serve it as index page 

No more digression - coming back to work.

Inside `index.php`, write this code
```php
<?php

echo "Hello World";

?>
```
It displays us `Hello World` - more about it in the next part

We're done there - what to do now?

2. XAMPP Control panel

Actually `xampp-control.exe` - this little guy allows us to control every package in XAMPP

![XAMPP control panel in folder](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hrwhxgv2ha729m5v9an8.png)

Open it - this window should pop up

![Control panel](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nhjjl7qqrp3anboq517a.png)

Start `Apache` by clicking on the `start` button next to it. 

That's the only one we're interested in today. Later I'll also talk about `MySQL`

Then, If everything went good you should have Apache highlighted with green color, like this


![Working Apache](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/32ppzcfa2sg7do1iv78i.png)


Last thing is - go to `http://localhost/server-test/` and check. If you see `Hello World` written on it - that means your server worked

Done and dusted. But what if I use linux?

### Environment - Debian-based

For other distros, like Fedora or Red Hat this won't be really useful
If you use Arch (btw) I've found [this gist](https://gist.github.com/superjojo140/18e250786d977b27571124f81bba5018) for you

Here, we'll configure everything separately - yet remember, XAMPP for linux (LAMPP) also exists

No more intro - let's go

#### Package installation

First thing - installing required packages, such as:

- `apache2`
- `mysql-server`
- `mysql-client`
- `php`
- `php-mysql`


Switch to root and update package lists - we need the newest version don't we?
```bash
$ sudo su
# apt-get update
```

And install everything using `apt` package manager
```
# apt-get install apache2 mysql-server mysql-client php php-mysql
```

Then, we have new catalogue - `/var/www/html`

But there is a problem - Only root has `write` privilege.

Let's give everyone write access

Note: This shouldn't be done on production sever (One accessible from other computers) - but here we are setting up development server, so convenience is more important than security

```
# chmod 777 /var/www/html
```

Now visit `localhost` and check if it works

You see the page with header `Apache default page`? Then concgrats - everything works as should

#### Setting up PHPMyAdmin

Then, let's install `phpmyadmin` - download the package
```bash
# apt-get install phpmyadmin
```

While installing, there config window should pop-up  - choose `apache2` and then  `dbconfig-common` - we have mysql, so no worries

It will create `phpmyadmin` mysql user - we should use it, rather than root, as it's and safer overall

As password I have chosen `phpmyadmin` - so it's simple to remember

![Setting up password](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7pw8ev4l7bukoa6j0m11.png)
Password configuration window

Retype it, and we should be good to go - visit `localhost/phpmyadmin`

If you get `404 Not found` error - don't panic, we can fix it

Open `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` file in your favourite editor - I'll open it in terminal with `nano`
```bash
# nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```

Then, at the very end add
```
Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf
```

And save using `Ctrl-O + Enter` combination, then use `Ctrl-X` to exit

Restart both `MySQL` and `Apache`
```bash
# systemctl restart apache2
# systemctl restart mysql
```

Now it should work - log into `phpmyadmin` with username `phpmyadmin` and password you have set up

Succesfully loged? Cool, that's everything we need

Log out using icon under logo

This one:

![Log out icon](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3dnv30bxzal2qatlrdr5.png){: .img-small}

Now, `phpmyadmin` works - but not fully
Luckily, these will be quick


#### Granting privileges for `phpmyadmin` user

Right now `phpmyadmin` can't really do anything except for browsing databases - It can't stay like this

Log into `mysql` as root
```
# mysql
```

Then set `mysql` as used database
```
mysql> USE mysql;
```

AWe need to grant necessary privileges to our user
```
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'phpmyadmin'@'localhost';
```

This basically means:
" Grant all privileges on every database to phpmyadmin at localhost" 

You see - That's SQL, but about it later in this course

Now, `FLUSH` (reset) privileges on mysql server - then exit
```
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> exit;
```

Restart both services
```bash
# systemctl restart apache2
# systemctl restart mysql
```

And the last (required) thing

#### Displaying errors in PHP

This is a development server, so we should know what's' wrong in our code - then server needs to show us errors and warnings

Open PHP configuration file (`php.ini`)

```bash
# nano /etc/php/[Your Version]/apache2/php.ini
```
You can check version by
1. `php -v` and copying first 2 digits - for me it was `8.1`
2. You can list directories in `/etc/php`, like this
```bash
# ls -la /etc/php
```
And copy directory name in place of `[Your Version]`

Now find these lines and change them accordingly:

-  `error_reporting = E_ALL`
-  `display_errors = On`
-  `display_startup_errors = On`
-  `log_error = On`
   

Here remember one thing - change values only for lines that doesn't start with semicolon (`;`)

Semicolon-starting lines are comments - changing them will do nothing (except for frustrating future you)

We can save and close it (like before), then restart apache
```bash
# systemctl restart apache2
```

Everything necessary done - I also want to show you one mor thing


#### Adding `.htaccess` file handling

That part is optional, as it's not really PHP
But.. we'll need it in the last part

So, let's add `.htaccess` handling - open apache config
```bash
# nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```

Scrolll to `<Directory /var/www/>` and set `AllowOverride` to `All` instead of `None` - this line should look like this
```
AllowOverride All
```

That's it - save and exit `nano`, then restart Apache

```
# systemctl restart apache2
```

Now, we have successfully set up Apache server on linux from scratch

Congrats

#### Another ways of configuring this

Of course, `Apache` is not the only choice here

Even just PHP package has it's own [development server](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php).

If not `Apache`, nor PHP development server - Nginx can be a solid choice as well. 
You can install it like `Apache`
```
$ sudo apt install nginx
```


### 4. Conclusion

That's it for today - I didn't include MacOS in here, as I don't have access to it. But, as name says, XAMPP is for every platform

I hope you learned something - and now have working setup for it

By the way, big thank you to polish IT channel on YouTube [Pasja Informatyki](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzn6vAfspIcagLax1fck_jw), as without them and their video about setting up PHP and SQL server on Linux, last part of this article would have been much harder to write.

This article draws to an end - you can leave me a follow and check out my other articles

We're done - see you in the next part (We will finally start coding something)
