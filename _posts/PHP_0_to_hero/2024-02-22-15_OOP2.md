Hi there! Welcome back to another exciting part of our PHP journey. 

As in [previous article](https://wizarddos.github.io/blog/programming/php_0_to_hero/14) we've learned a little about OOP theory - today it's time for practice

<!--more-->
So, what do we do today?

1. Declaring classes and naming conventions
2. Properties and methods with encapsulation
3. How to declare constructors
4. Inheritance

But not only theory - we'll be creating database handler, you can use later on

No more talking - off we go.

## Classes

To create a class, we use the `class` keyword:

```php
class ClassName {

}
```

Ever wondered why a class name starts with a capital letter? 
It's the `StudlyCaps` convention, and it's the PSR-accepted naming convention for classes. 
So, remember, class names always start with a capital letter.

Now, let's dive into the details.

## Properties and Methods

For the sake of readability, when creating a class, it's common practice to first declare properties and then methods. 
The first method declared should be the constructor, and the last should be the destructor.

Let's start creating our database connection class. Create a file called `db-class.php` and declare the `DatabaseHandler` class:

```php
class DatabaseHandler {
}
```

### Properties

Now, let's declare the properties. We need DSN, database user, and database password:

```php
private $db_dsn;
private $db_user;
private $db_pass;
protected $db_conn;
```

Since we don't need to access these data from outside of this class, we've made them private. `$db_conn` is protected, as it might be useful somewhere later.

Our class now looks like this:

```php
class DatabaseHandler {
    private $db_dsn;
    private $db_user;
    private $db_pass;
    protected $db_conn;
}
```

### Methods

Why create a database handler if it can't handle database connections? Let's fix that. 
We'll start with a constructor. To declare it, we create a function called `__construct` (with 2 underscores at the beginning):

```php
public function __construct($dsn, $username, $password) {

}
```

Now, let's add some content there:

```php
public function __construct($dsn, $username, $password) {
    $this->db_dsn = $dsn;
    $this->db_user = $username;
    $this->db_pass = $password;
    $this->db_conn = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password);
}
```

That's what the constructor is for: initializing the class. 
And what's this mysterious `$this`? It's a reference to the current object.

Now, with the help of [this](https://wizarddos.github.io/blog/programming/php_0_to_hero/12), [this](https://wizarddos.github.io/blog/programming/php_0_to_hero/14), [this](https://wizarddos.github.io/blog/programming/php_0_to_hero/13), and [this](https://wizarddos.github.io/blog/programming/php_0_to_hero/9) article, I challenge you to write a method that executes SQL queries and returns their results as associative arrays. In the next article, I'll share my solution with comments on how it works.

That's it! Our class is ready:

```php
class DatabaseHandler {
    private $db_dsn;
    private $db_user;
    private $db_pass;
    protected $db_conn;

    public function __construct($dsn, $username, $password) {
        $this->db_dsn = $dsn;
        $this->db_user = $username;
        $this->db_pass = $password;
        $this->db_conn = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password);
    }

    // This is where you write your method
}
```

### Inheritance

Now, let's shift our focus to inheritance. 
We won't be needing it in our handler - so let's copy example from part 14

Now, we'll talk about code:

```php
<?php

class Person {
    public $name;
    protected $age;
    private $phone;

    public function talk() {
        // Do stuff here
    }

    protected function walk() {
        // Do stuff here
    }

    private function swim() {
        // Do stuff here
    }
}

class Tom extends Person {
    // Tom class extends Person class
    // Tom inherits all public and protected members from Person

    // So class Tom will have these properties and methods:
    // public $name;
    // protected $age;
    // public function talk(){}
    // protected function walk(){}

    // But it will not inherit the private members
    // This is what object inheritance means
}
```

Notice this line:

```php
class Tom extends Person
```

To create a child class, we use the `extends` keyword. The recipe for a child class is:

```php
class ChildName extends ParentName
```

And that's it - I strongly encourage to experiment with code and do something cool with it

## Conclusion
