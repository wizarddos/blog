Welcome, time to learn again.

I think that everyone heard, that you don't need math in **web dev**. And that's a little tricky 
Even though yes - stuff like linear algebra or some advanced calculus may not be the most valuable knowlegde for us, yet mathematical logic or arithmetic is very useful
<!--more-->
And that will be our focus today, I'll also add something about **sessions** and present how useful they are

So, we will learn today

1. Basic arithmetic operations (addition, division etc.)
2. Square roots and exponentiation
3. Logic operators
4. Something about sessions 
5. `switch` statement

It will end with a short example project - a very basic calculator

With that said - let's go

## Numbers and fractions

Start with creating new variables, just like in previous article - let's call them `a` and `b`(never call them like this in real life)
```php
$a = 25;
$b = 5;
```

These, will be 2 values I'll use later

This time, I used integers - but you can use whatever you want to
Double and floats are also in PHP. It's possible to write something like this
```php
$c = -4.5;
```

And remember - decimal fractions are written with `.` (dot) and not `,`(comma)
With this said - let's explore further

## Basic arithmetic

Any basic mathematical operation is done, like on paper. 

To do it, we use **operators**. Another term? 

It's a construct that takes an expression (one or more values) and then returns us something else, technically also becoming an expression

What does it mean - let's see example
```php
echo $a + $b;
// 30
```
`+` here is an **operator** - it connects two values and then yields other value, also becoming the expression

Rest is similar 

Subtraction - use `-`:
```php
echo $a - $b;
// 20
```
Multiplying - use `*`:
```php
echo $a * $b;
// 125
```
Division use `/`:
```php
echo $a / $b;
// 5
```
And last operation - **modulo** (`%`)
```php
echo $a % $b;
```

What is modulo? 
It's remainder of division - if you divide 3 by 2 you get 1 and a 1 as a reminder.

No time to waste, let's get further

## Roots and exponentiation

Here, it gets a little bit trickier

To write the exponential expression - we have 2 methods

1. using `**` operator
```php
echo 5 ** 2;
// 25
```
2. Using `pow()` funtction
```php
echo pow(5, 2);
// 25
```

Personally - first one suits me better. I like simplicity that comes with operators

And square roots. They don't have any operator - just `sqrt()` function 
```php
echo sqrt($a);
// 5
```

But what if we want get other root than square one - 
We can use old trick - power to a fraction
```php
echo pow(8, 1/3);
// 2
```

Remember that if you power something to a fraction with numerator = 1, you get a denominators root of that number

Let's get to the last, and really important part

## Logical Operations

Pay attention, as we will be using logical operators very often

First - some theoretical and more mathematical info

Let's get the expression (with our previous variables) 
```
$a + $b = 30
// 25 + 5 = 30
```

If we want to evaluate it's logical value - we check if `25 + 5` really equals 30

And yes, it does - so our check will return true
```php
var_dump((bool) ($a + $b == 30));
// bool(true) 
```
Quick side note: This `(bool)` inside `var_dump` indicates what type of data should get returned

And it does - now, what's that strange symbol between `$b` and `30`?

That's a **comparison operator** named `equal` - this means "Do these 2 expressions have the same value?". If yes, it returns true. If not - false;

Why not `=`? Because `=` is a symbol of **assignment** - It would create a lot of mess, so it was standardized to `==`

Let's see them all of those operators in action

1. `===` -  **Identical**. Difference between this and `equal` is, that it also checks type
So this
```php
var_dump((bool) ($a + $b == 30.0));
// bool(true)
```

Gives us `true` or `1` (it's the same and can be used interchangeably)

But if we use `===`
```php
var_dump((bool) ($a + $b === 30.0));
// bool(false) 
```
We get `false` (or `0` - it's the same too)

Why? We added 2 integers - so result is integer. Yet here, we are comparing it to a float
And `float 30.0` is not the same as `int 30`

2. `!=` - **Not equal**. The opposite of `==` - will return `true` if expressions don't have the same value

```php
var_dump((bool) ($a + $b != 32));
// bool(true)
```

Not equal has also it's alternative - `<>`. But you shouldn't use it in your code. `!=` is much more readable. 

I mentioned it, as it can sometimes be seen in older codes - so you know

3. `!==` - **Not identical**. The difference here is the same as between `==` and `===`. This operator checks also types

So this:
```php
var_dump((bool) ($a + $b !== 30.0));
// bool(true)
```

Gives us `true`, because the types don't match

4. `<`, `>` - **less than** and **greater than**. I put them together because 
 - We already know one of them - it appeared in pt. 3 
 - They are identical to their math equivalent 

```php
var_dump((bool) ($a + $b > 10.0));
// bool(true) 
```

And the same goes another way - I hope you get the point of operators?

Now last ones:

5. `>=` - **Greater than or equal to**.  It will return true if expression on right side is grater or equal to one on the left side

It's math equivalent is `≥`

```php
var_dump((bool) ($a + $b >= 10)); // bool(true)
// And also
var_dump((bool) ($a + $b >= 30)); // bool(true)
```

6. `<=` - **Less than or equal to**. This one is the opposite of previous one

It's mathematical symbol is `≤`
```php
var_dump((bool) ($a + $b <= 10)); // bool(false)
// And also
var_dump((bool) ($a + $b <= 30)); // bool(true)
```

And that's it - pretty much every operator you need to know

For some further explanation - visiting [PHP docs](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php) is recommended

So now, let's leave the theory and start writing our calculator

## Practical Project - Calculator

First start your server and create a new folder - I'll call it `calculator` and inside `index.php`

What we need now is basic HTML template

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Calculator</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form action="calculate.php" method = "GET">
        <input type="number" name="num1" id="" />
        <input type="number" name="num2" id="" />
        <select name = "operation">
            <option value ="add">Add</option>
            <option value ="subtract">Subtract</option>
            <option value ="multiply">Multiply</option>
            <option value ="divide">Divide</option>
            <option value = "expon">Exponentiation</option>
            <option value = "root"> Square Root</option>
            <option value = "modulo">Modulo</option>
        </select>

        <button type="submit">Calculate</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

What is `<select>`? - It's this drop-down form field

![Select element in pratcise](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7kafxwdlvoe4p7oiho4v.png){: .img-small}

It has `operation` as name - this works just as in any other form field.

And each `<option>` element represents... the option. So, content of the tag is the label in form field, but `value` is the value of `$_GET['operation']` then in PHP

With this said - let's dive deeper

Now, `action` element isn't empty - so we will create a new file called `calculate.php` solely for PHP code.

Inside a file, add PHP tag and check if data is present, we will save it to additional variables and declare another one called `result` - it will be useful in the end

```php
<?php

if(!isset($_GET['num1'])){
    header("Location: index.php");
    exit();
}

$num1 = $_GET['num1'];
$num2 = $_GET['num2'];
$operation = $_GET['operation'];
$result = 0;
```

Now, we could spend a lot of time writing if-else structures, creating really big mess (so-called spaghetti code). 

But there is another, more optimal way

### switch statement
Rhere is a structure, that can replace a lot of if-else code - so make it clearer

Let's write and then analyze it 

```php
switch($operation){
    case "add": $result = $num1 + $num2; break;
    case "subtract": $result = $num1 - $num2; break;
    case "multiply": $result = $num1*$num2; break;
    case "divide": $result = $num1/$num2; break;
    case "expon": $result = $num1**$num2; break;
    case "root": $result = sqrt($num1); break;
    case "modulo": $result = $num1%$num2; break;

    default: $result = "Invalid operation chosen"; break;
}
```
So, step by step

Inside brackets `switch` takes a value which will then be compared - here it's`$operation`

And then - we address the case
```php
 case "add": $result = $num1 + $num2; break;
```

This can be represented as 
```php
if($operation == "add"){
   $result = $num1 + $num2;
}
```
And the same is done with each and every `case` - it compares if value in quotes is equal to `$operation` value


Also, we have 2 new keywords here

1. `break`- It finishes the statement early
    If `$num1 = 4` and `$num2 = 2` and `$operation = "divide"`, we would have everything below `case "divide"` executed
    So, first `$result` would really equal `2`, then it would change to`16`, then again to `2`, then `0` and in the end, we would get a message `Invalid operation chosen`
    Sometimes it may be useful - but don't forget `break;` if you want to replace `if-else` with `switch`


2.  `default` - This case, matches if no other one was found before. 
    If somehow `$operations` will be set to `ILoveBananas`, it doesn't match at all
    So, code in `default` will be invoked  - We'll see `Invalid operation chosen`

(Yes, you have to think about such edge-cases. Not everyone will use your websites as they are meant to be used)

Now, let's display the value

Append to the file
```php
echo $result;
```
This file looks like this
```php
<?php

if(!isset($_GET['num1'])){
    header("Location: index.php");
    exit();
}

$num1 = $_GET['num1'];
$num2 = $_GET['num2'];
$operation = $_GET['operation'];
$result = 0;

switch($operation){
    case "add": $result = $num1 + $num2; break;
    case "subtract": $result = $num1 - $num2; break;
    case "multiply": $result = $num1*$num2; break;
    case "divide": $result = $num1/$num2; break;
    case "expon": $result = $num1**$num2; break;
    case "root": $result = sqrt($num1); break;
    case "modulo": $result = $num1%$num2; break;

    default: $result = "Invalid operation chosen"; break;
}

echo $result;
```
After submitting the form - you should see a page with a number


That's great, but wouldn't we like to have it on the same page as form?

Let's talk about  **session** now

## Sessions 


First, at the beginning of each file add 
```php
session_start();
```

In `index.php` place it right above `Doctype` inside PHP tags

That function either starts, or resumes existing session.

So, if we start the session in `index.php`, then switch to `calculate.php` - it will get resumed


Then, we can use really important feature called **Session Variables**

To access them, you select a specific field in superglobal associative array called `$_SESSION` - You use it just like `$_GET`, but here you can add whatever you want without limitation

So, let's create one for `$result` and redirect user to calculate page
```php
$_SESSION['result'] = $result;

header("Location: index.php");
```

When it's done, we can go to `index.php` and below form add a new PHP tag

```php
<?php

?>
``` 

Don't forget the closing here

Now, just display it like normal variable
```php
echo $_SESSION['result'];
```
Right? 

Not really - If you do that, and refresh the page without sending a form, you will see this messages
```
Warning: Undefined variable $_SESSION in [PATH REDACTED] on line 25

Warning: Trying to access array offset on value of type null in [PATH REDACTED] on line 25
```

Not so cool, how do we fix it? Go to the start of `calculate.php`. Do you remember this?
```php
if(!isset($_GET['num1'])){
    // Code responsible for redirection
}
```

That's what we have to do here too - check if the value is set, and if yes, display it

Simple, isn't it? Now, let's write it
```php
        if(isset($_SESSION['result'])){
            echo "Result is:";
            echo $_SESSION['result'];
            exit();
        }
```

And it works! - no errors.
Now let's calculate something - like `5+2`


![Result](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eb59iky1cs50n3ypzwyf.png)

It also works - well done. 

That's how you have written you calculator - good job!


## Conclusion

Of course - code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wizarddos/Dev.to-scripts/tree/master/PHP%200%20to%20hero) for you. By the way, I realized that there is no code for part 3. It will be uploaded as well

I hope you liked it, and learned something

I am always open for your feedback - that's what comments are for.
