Finally, in the third part we start learning PHP 

Today we will be creating a simple script for checking user's age, based on their input
<!--more-->

With this explained and our environment set, off we go.

## Table of contents

Today we will learn how to

1. Display text and HTML in PHP
2. Use `$_GET` superglobal and basics of form handling
3. Write basic conditional statements with `if-else` construct 

So, maybe let's start with executing code

### Executing code in PHP

Do you remember part 1 of this course? 
We've wrote this code
```php
<?php
echo "Hello World";
?>
```

And it displays `Hello World`- but first we see `<?php` 

What does it mean? 
It's the opening of **php tag**. 

PHP will only get executed if it's inside `<?php ?>` tags - every file with PHP code has them inside.

There can be multiple PHP tags in one file

And if we only have PHP code inside file (So no additional HTML) you can omit closing tag (`?>`)

What does it mean? That code from above can also be rewritten as 
```php
<?php
echo "Hello World";
```


By the way, in older code you can find  `<? ?>` instead of `<?php ?>`. 
These are **short tags**. For portability reasons, you shouldn't use them. Some servers have this function disabled by default - so your code won't work

Now, to our code - let's create a new folder inside `htdocs` called `age-checker`,
add `index.php` file inside it and open it in your code editor

At first - I created a simple form 
```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Age checker</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Are you old enough to access this page?</h1>
    <form action="" method="GET">
        <input type="number" name="age" id="" placeholder="Enter your age">
        <button type="submit">Check age</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

(If you don't understand content - [go back to the previous part](https://wizarddos.github.io/blog/programming/php_0_to_hero/2))

Now, after we run it - we should see this 

![Result of our HTML](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5c0ftrrd7a5re5svw5me.png)

(Note: Remember, that to use PHP you need to have your environment running and head to `http://localhost/[path_to_your_file]` to execute it)

Okay, form is present

We can write our age in there, but how to check it?

## PHP introduction

Let's write the **logic**. Add php tags (`<?php ?>`) after form 
```php
<?php

?>
```

Now inside it, we need to check **if** we got something from the form

```php
if(!isset($_GET['age'])){
   exit();
}
```

These lines mean "If `$_GET['age']` is not set (`!`), finish the script"

What is this - `$_GET['age']`?

That's how we get data from GET form - inside single quotes we place name of the field

And let's look at the if too - basic structure looks like this

```php
if(condition){
    code
}
```

Similar to other programming languages - this code means
> If the condition is true, execute code

When we are sure, we have data to operate on - let's start writing our conditions

First - If user isn't and adult (is less than 18 years old) display proper message
```php
if($_GET['age'] < 18){
            echo "<p>Access denied - You are too young to visit this website</p>";
}
```

Have a closer look at the condition

```php
$_GET['age'] < 18
```
Do you remember comparing 2 numbers in math? That's what we do here

That piece of code can be read as
> Is `$_GET['age']` smaller than 18? 

But, what if we actually meet that condition? Let's code it as well

Delete closing bracket, and add
```php
}else{
    echo "<p>Access granted - Welcome";
}
```

Now, we added an alternative. If condition isn't met - execute this code. Let's add one more thing. 

As developers we have to make our code as foolproof as possible. Someone may try to send us *text* instead of  *number*

To check if something is a number we use `is_numeric` function

In between those 2 ifs, add one more

```php
if(!is_numeric($_GET['age'])){
    echo "<p>Your age must be a number</p>";
    exit();
}
```

Now, we have time to talk about that exclamation mark - `!` symbolizes negation
So, while `is_numeric($_GET['age'])` would mean
> Is `$_GET['age']` numeric?

`!is_numeric($_GET['age'])` means
> Is `$_GET['age']` **not** numeric?

This `!` represents **not**.

If we pass numeric value, `is_numeric` will return `true`. 
If something is **not true**, it is **false** - and this will be returned value from `!is_numeric($_GET['age'])`

Congrats, we've done it - you have successfully wrote your first code in PHP

Our overall code looks like this
```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Age checker</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Are you old enough to access this page?</h1>
    <form action="" method="GET">
        <input type="number" name="age" id="" placeholder="Enter your age">
        <button type="submit">Check age</button>
    </form>
    <?php
        if(!isset($_GET['age'])){
            exit();
        }

        if(!is_numeric($_GET['age'])){
            echo "<p>Your age must be a number</p>";
            exit();
        }

        if($_GET['age'] < 18){
            echo "<p>Access denied - You are too young to visit this website</p>";
        }else{
            echo "<p>Access granted - Welcome, this is only for adult users";
        }
    ?>
</body>
</html>
```
## Afterword

When everything has been configured - We've done our first PHP task

Since now, learning PHP will be our only focus here. No additional configs or other stuff
