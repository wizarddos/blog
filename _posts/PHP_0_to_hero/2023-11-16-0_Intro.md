Welcome again. I know hadn't written anything for a while now, but here I am.

I'd like to introduce you to a new series - A full PHP guide.
<!--more-->

In this tutorial my main goal will be to teach you how to use PHP to create useful scripts and good looking codebase.

### Tutorial Structure

There will be 2 major parts of this course

1. Fundamentals - A pile of articles about basics of PHP, such as variables, SQL operations, if-else etc. with easy to understand examples
2. Projects - The practical part of this course. We will be making 2 projects using knowledge from first part. 
(I can spoil you one thing - first project may be something like a social-media platform)

Nothing more to say here - let's learn a bit of theory (the most boring part to be honest, but it's useful to know)

### Name Origin

PHP is an acronym. To make it more interesting it's recursive acronym. 

PHP stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" -  And what does "PHP" inside it mean? "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" - you get the rule, don't you?

### A little bit more about PHP

PHP is a scripting language created in 1995 by Rasmus Lerdorf.

You can check it's newest stable version on official website [php.net](https://www.php.net/)

If you know PHP and want to use it, you could become a back-end developer 

The main, and promoted principal is OOP - stands for Object Oriented programming

If this sounds complicated - don't worry. I'll explain it later

### Announcement 

I guess that's everything theoretical we should know about PHP - the next part will be about installing and configuring PHP's environment on both Linux and Windows 

Stay tuned and leave me a follow to not miss a new part of this course

So, that's it. See you next time
