Welcome again. This will be a very short article.

I'd like to introduce you to a new series - a full PHP guide.
<!--more-->

In addition to typical programming course elements, such as commands and syntax, I'll also:
1. Show how to write well-structured and easy-to-maintain code.
2. Discuss securing your websites against common attacks.
3. Guide you so that we can create scripts that you can then use on your website.
4. Strongly encourage you to frequently research PHP docs in case you're stuck.

### Tutorial Structure

This course consists of two parts:

1. Fundamentals - Basics of PHP, such as variables, SQL operations, if-else, etc., with easy-to-understand examples.
2. Projects - The practical part. We will be making some projects and applying them to real-world scenarios. (I can spoil you one thing - one of the projects may be something like a social media platform.)

Let's now learn a bit of theory.

### A Little about PHP

PHP is an acronym. To make it more interesting, it's a recursive acronym.

PHP stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" - And what does "PHP" inside it mean? "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" - and so on.

PHP is a scripting language created in 1995 by Rasmus Lerdorf.

You can check its newest stable version on the official website [php.net](https://www.php.net/).

If you know PHP and want to use it, you could become a backend developer.

The main and promoted principle is OOP - stands for Object-Oriented Programming (I'll talk more about it in parts 14 and 15).

## Afterword

That's all the theoretical information we should know about PHP.

In the next part, we will be installing and configuring PHP's environment on both Linux and Windows.

Stay tuned, leave me a follow, and subscribe to my newsletter - so you don't miss any new parts of this course.

That's it. See you next time.
